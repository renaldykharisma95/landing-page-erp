# SOAL KEDUA: ERP Landing Page

## Overview

This project is an ERP Landing Page that was bootstrapped with Create React App. It serves as a template for building ERP-related applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renaldykharisma95/erp-landingpage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd erp-landingpage
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`yarn start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

- **`yarn build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- **`yarn test`**:  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode using react-scripts test. It automatically detects changes and re-runs the affected tests. This is useful during development to ensure your components and logic stay reliable as your app evolves. Press a to run all tests, or use filter options to run specific files.

- **`yarn coverage`**:  Runs the test suite and generates a code coverage report using yarn test -u --coverage. It updates snapshots and tracks how much of your codebase is covered by tests. After execution, a detailed HTML report is available in the coverage folder, showing which lines, functions, and branches are tested. Great for identifying untested parts of your app.

- **`yarn eject`**: Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and give you full control over the configuration files.
