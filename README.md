### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- Yarn (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renaldykharisma95/erp-landingpage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`yarn start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

- **`yarn build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- **`yarn eject`**: Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and give you full control over the configuration files.
